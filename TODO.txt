Backend

  bugs
    logout sometimes doesn't remove account info from menu bar
    saving account info replaces image if none is selected
    get actual league updates when updating league
    flashes sometimes get lost
    flashes on form errors and res.redirect('back') makes form submit disabled
    roster times are weird, make sure node and mongo time is nsync
    properly send back req.body on form failures (login, register, create league)

  features
    add chat to activity feed
    user flair
      allow mods to check "show moderator flair" when sending message

  league rules
    unique rosters
    number of roster spots
    time limit for draft

  draft
    switch league open to false
    this could get hairy if site experiences performance issues.
    autodraft based on list
    skip after time limit
    once all players have had a chance to draft all spots, free-for-all

  rosters
    check if roster is full when adding player
    redirect flow for replacing player on full roster
    propose trade system
  
  player performance prediction
    tomorrow's top predictions
    next 7 days top prediction
    league average

  schedule tasks
